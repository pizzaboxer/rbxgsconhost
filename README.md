# RBXGS Console Host
 
A runtime environment for RBXGS, allowing you to run it without needing IIS (effectively making it work like RCCService).

```
Usage:
  -h, --help            Print this help message
  -p, --port <port>     Specify web server port (default is 64989)
  -b, --baseDir <path>  Specify path where RBXGS is located (default is working dir)
```

Code must be compiled using MSVC 8. 

StandardOut redirection will not work on older versions of Windows (XP/Server 2003).
